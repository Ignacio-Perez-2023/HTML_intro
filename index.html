<!-- h1 is for first level header. h2 is for 2nd level header, 
    and p is for a paragraph. All these create their own whitespace

* In-line elements like "strong" dont create their own whitespace. 
They modify the style of the element in line

*You always need the "Doctype", HTML , head and body for this to be a "valid" html file
    For this, at the very beginning you can just write "!" and Gitpot will provide all the structure needed

*HTML is for the structure of the document only, not for the layout nor look an feel. CSS is the tool
that will be used to influce style

*HTML can be used to present info and to collect info from users too
    You need a page to collectthe form data, and another to accept the form data 

* developer.mozilla.org -- good resource for commands and elements on HTML language
